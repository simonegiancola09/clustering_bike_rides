Datasets and problem provided by [H-farm](https://www.h-farm.com/en) <br>

[Capital Bikeshare](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/)'s business model is weather/season dependent. This trend is a damage for the company. The following project proposes a quantitative backed method to propose a solution. We find evidence that the problem exists and that a potential partial solution would be a month membership in collaboration with public transports. This is achieved through clustering analysis of the rides, problem formulation, hypothesis testing through regression on results obtained with a survey (> 1000 answers). <br>
While the representativeness of our sample is arguable, we elaborate on this and propose the most intuitively robust approach (more on the report). Other limitations are discussed as well. <br>
Outline of the contents and tools used in the repository:
* Clustering: Python notebook
* Regression, testing, data collection: STATA do files (course requirement)
* Survey: distributed on Reddit and to friends, developed using Qualtrics
* Report: 25 page limit, with discussions about the framework for scientific decisions proposed in class
* Presentation: brief 15 minute powerpoint to pitch the idea in front of the class, the professors, and H-farm employees. 
* Datasets: csv files cloned inside the notebook
